This version of Palette editor work with Pygobject (Gtk for python), which is not really easy to install on Windows computers but on linux distribution with gnome (like ubuntu, popOS etc...) it works perfectly.
From my point of view, this version is nicer and more powerfull than the pygame version, so USE LINUX if you want to be able to use it (you won't regret it, Linux is better than Windows).
If you really want to use it on windows, it's possible using msys2, more informations here => https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

(This features is not finish yet, use the pygame version for now => release of GtkPalette editor will be arrive very soon)
