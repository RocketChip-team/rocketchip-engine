Principal Classes:
 -Sheet
 -Tile
 -MetaTile

Secondary Classes:
 -Adaptative Tile [Child of Tile, can't be used alone unless modified.]
 -Adaptative MetaTile [Child of MetaTile.]
 -Animated MetaTile [Child of MetaTile.]


Sheet:
 [This is a PRIMORDIAL class, it holds graphic data from .chr files (see
 Sprite Editor Documentation) and draws it on a given pygame.Surface with
 a given palette.]
 Methods:

  -self.__init__(filename)
  [This method is the class constructor and is executed automatically, it
  gets graphic data from the filename option, which is a file name's or
  raw-data.]

  -self.draw(surface, x, y, index, palette, {flipx=0, flipy=0, swap=0, scale=1})
  [This method draws the tile with the number index onto the surface with the
  given palette, optional options are flipx (flip horizontally), flipy(flip
  vertically), swap(rotate 90°) [these three options are ONLY 1 or 0] and scale
  (by default 1, if 0 this will draw nothing usable).]

 Variables:
  -self.data [Basically the graphic data.]


Tile:
 [This is more or less a data container, holding a Sheet class, position variables,
 draw index, palette, flipping and swapping, ect., but everything this class defines
 that's things you will not have to.]

 Methods:
  -self.__init__(x, y, sheet, palette, index, tag, {flipx=0, flipy=0, swap=0, scale=1})
  [This method is the class constructor and is executed automatically, it retrieves all
  given data to draw correctly and at the right position, optional options are the same
  as the one of the Sheet.draw method]

  -self.draw(surface)
  [This method draws the tile with all the prior given data onto the given pygame.Surface]

 Variables:
  -self.x [x axis position]
  -self.y [y axis position]
  -self.sheet [Sheet class for drawing]
  -self.palette [palette data for drawing]
  -self.index [index for drawing]
  -self.tag [for identification, used later in AdaptativeMetaTile and AdaptativeTile]
  -self.flipx [horizontal flip]
  -self.flipy [vertical flip]
  -self.swap [90° rotation]
  -self.scale [scaling factor, for drawing]

MetaTile:
 [This is a Tile container, making the process of drawing larger pictures easier to do,
 it can potentially be of any size. It needs all the indexes, flips, and swaps of each tiles,
 there is a method to modify these though]

 Methods:
  -self.__init__(x, y, sheet, palette, indexes, flips, size, tag, {scale=1})
  [This method is the class constructor and is executed automatically, it retrieves all
  given data to draw correctly and at the right position a group of Tile instances,
  flips include flipx, flipy and swap of each tile, in the following format :

  [[flipx, flipy, swap], [flipx, flipy, swap], ect.].

  Each list of flips is for one tile,
  from the top left to the top right:]

  -self.setiles(indexes, flips)
  [replace current tile's indexes and flips with the given ones]

  -self.getpalette()
  [return current palette]

  -self.setpalette(palette)
  [replace current palette with the given one]

  -self.drawtiles()
  [pre-render the tiles, this saves processing time instead of drawing from scratch every tile
  every frame]

  -self.draw(surface)
  [draw the pre-rendered tiles onto the given surface]

 Variables:
  -self.x [
